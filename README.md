This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML error related to using innerHTML.  The issue arises from attempting to manipulate the innerHTML property of an element before the element has been fully parsed and added to the Document Object Model (DOM).  This typically happens when the script attempting to manipulate the element is placed before the element itself in the HTML file.  The solution involves restructuring the HTML to ensure the element exists before the script runs or using DOMContentLoaded event.
